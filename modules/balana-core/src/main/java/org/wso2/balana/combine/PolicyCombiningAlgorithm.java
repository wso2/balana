/**
 * The base type for all Policy combining algorithms. Unlike in Rule Combining Algorithms, each

 * policies, obligations must be handled correctly. Specifically, no obligation may be included in
 * the <code>Result</code> that doesn't match the effect being returned. So, if INDETERMINATE or
 * NOT_APPLICABLE is the returned effect, no obligations may be included in the result. If the
 * effect of the combining algorithm is PERMIT or DENY, then obligations with a matching fulfillOn
 * effect are also included in the result.
