 * This class is used by the parsing routines to handle the relationships between variable
 * references and definitions. Specifically, it takes care of the fact that definitions can be
 * placed after their first reference, and can use references to create circular or recursive
 * relationships. It keeps track of what's in the process of being parsed and will pre-parse
 * elements as needed.
 * <p>
 * Note that you should never have to use this class directly. It is really meant only as a utility
 * for the internal parsing routines. Also, note that the operations on this class are not
 * thread-safe. Typically this doesn't matter, since the code doesn't support using more than one
 * thread to parse a single Policy.
