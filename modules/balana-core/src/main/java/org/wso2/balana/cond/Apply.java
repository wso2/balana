 * Represents the XACML ApplyType and ConditionType XML types.

 * Note well: as of 2.0, there is no longer a notion of a separate higher- order bag function.
 * Instead, if needed, it is supplied as one of the <code>Expression</code>s in the parameter list.
 * As such, when this <code>Apply</code> is evaluated, it no longer pre-evaluates all the parameters
 * if a bag function is used. It is now up to the implementor of a higher-order function to do this.
 * <p>
 * Also, as of 2.0, the <code>Apply</code> is no longer used to represent a Condition, since the
 * XACML 2.0 specification changed how Condition works. Instead, there is now a
 * <code>Condition</code> class that represents both 1.x and 2.0 style Conditions.
