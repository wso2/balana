/**
 * Factory used to create all functions. There are three kinds of factories: general, condition, and
 * target. These provide functions that can be used anywhere, only in a condition's root and only in
 * a target (respectively).
 * <p>
 * Note that all functions, except for abstract functions, are singletons, so any instance that is
 * added to a factory will be the same one returned from the create methods. This is done because
 * most functions don't have state, so there is no need to have more than one, or to spend the time
 * creating multiple instances that all do the same thing.
