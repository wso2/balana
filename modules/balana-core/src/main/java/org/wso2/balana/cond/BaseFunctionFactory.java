/**
 * This is a basic implementation of <code>FunctionFactory</code>. It implements the insertion and
 * retrieval methods, but it doesn't actually setup the factory with any functions. It also assumes
 * a certain model with regard to the different kinds of functions (Target, Condition, and General).
 * For this reason, you may want to re-use this class, or you may want to extend FunctionFactory
 * directly, if you're writing a new factory implementation.
 * <p>
 * Note that while this class is thread-safe on all creation methods, it is not safe to add support
 * for a new function while creating an instance of a function. This follows from the assumption
 * that most people will initialize these factories up-front, and then start processing without ever
 * modifying the factories. If you need these mutual operations to be thread-safe, then you should
 * write a wrapper class that implements the right synchronization.
