/**
 * This is a basic implementation of <code>CombiningAlgFactory</code>. It implements the insertion
 * and retrieval methods, but doesn't actually setup the factory with any algorithms.
 * <p>
 * Note that while this class is thread-safe on all creation methods, it is not safe to add support
 * for a new algorithm while creating an instance of an algorithm. This follows from the assumption
 * that most people will initialize these factories up-front, and then start processing without ever
 * modifying the factories. If you need these mutual operations to be thread-safe, then you should
 * write a wrapper class that implements the right synchronization.
