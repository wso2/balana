  This package defines proxy classes for all of the standard
  datatypes. This package was introduced in version 1.2 with the new
  run-time configuration code, which needs concrete proxy classes to add
  datatype support to a factory. Before 1.2, the
  <code>AttributeFactory</code> used annonymous classes to cut down on
  the total number of files in this project.
