This package defines proxy classes for all of the standard
datatypes. This package was introduced in version 1.2 with the new
run-time configuration code, which needs concrete proxy classes to add
datatype support to a factory. Before 1.2, the
<code>AttributeFactory</code> used annonymous classes to cut down on
the total number of files in this project.
