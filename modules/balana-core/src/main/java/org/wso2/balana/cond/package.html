Support for Conditions is in this package. This contains all of the
function code, including base types, implementations of all of the
standard functions, and a factory for getting functions and adding new
ones to the system. There is also support for the Condition and Apply
XML types.
<p>
    Note that prior to the 1.2 release, most of the function
    implementations in this package were package private, mostly because
    there is no reason to interact with these classes directly. With the
    1.2 release all classes were exposed, in part to make all the standard
    identifier strings easily available. If you need a function instance,
    however, you should still use the factory interface. You should not
    ever need to instantiate one of the standard function classes
    directly. Note also that in the next major release some of the
    function impementations may change their interfaces, which is another
    reason to interact with the standard functions only through the
    factory interface.
