  Support for Conditions is in this package. This contains all of the
  function code, including base types, implementations of all of the
  standard functions, and a factory for getting functions and adding new
  ones to the system. There is also support for the Condition and Apply
  XML types.
  <p>
  Note that prior to the 1.2 release, most of the function
  implementations in this package were package private, mostly because
  there is no reason to interact with these classes directly. With the
  1.2 release all classes were exposed, in part to make all the standard
  identifier strings easily available. If you need a function instance,
  however, you should still use the factory interface. You should not
  ever need to instantiate one of the standard function classes
  directly. Note also that in the next major release some of the
  function impementations may change their interfaces, which is another
  reason to interact with the standard functions only through the
  factory interface.
