/**
 * This class is used by the PDP to find all policies used in evaluation. A PDP is given a
 * pre-configured <code>PolicyFinder</code> on construction. The <code>PolicyFinder</code> provides
 * the functionality both to find policies based on a request (ie, retrieve policies and match
 * against the target) and based on an idReference (as can be included in a PolicySet).
 * <p>
 * While this class is typically used by the PDP, it is intentionally designed to support
 * stand-alone use, so it could be the base for a distributed service, or for some application that
 * needs just this functionality. There is nothing in the <code>PolicyFinder</code that relies on
 * the functionality in the PDP. An example of this is a PDP that offloads all policy work by
 * passing requests to another server that does all the retrieval, and passes back the applicable
 * policy. This would require custom code undefined in the XACML spec, but it would free up the
 * server to focus on core policy processing.
 * <p>
 * Note that it is an error to have more than one top-level policy (as explained in the
 * OnlyOneApplicable combining algorithm), so any module that is added to this finder will be
 * evaluated each time a policy is requested. This means that you should think carefully about how
 * many modules you include, and how they can cache policy data.
