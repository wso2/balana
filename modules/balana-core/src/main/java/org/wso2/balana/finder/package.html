The <code>finder</code> package supports all of the pieces of the
XACML specification that require custom implementation. Specifically,
there are classes here to manage looking for attributes outside of the
physical request document, finding policies, and resolving resource
identifiers. There are also base classes used to build new modules
that can perform different application specific tasks to support these
three kinds of operations. These managers are used directly by the
PDP, and the managers in turn use the modules, and return values using
the return-value classes in this package.
